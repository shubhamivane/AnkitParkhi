![Alt text](https://www.caleidoscope.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Leather-Artistry-in-India.jpg "a title")

<p style="text-align: justify">The leather industry in India is historical. And leather products have a huge market both domestically, as well as internationally. The common leather products include shoes, bags, pouches, and more. Leather in India dates back to as early as 3000 BC with references about it made in Vedas too. The leather industry though largely is about manufacturing and marketing. There is a significant amount of artistry and skill that this particular industry merits.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">From a creative view, leather products are exceptionally versatile and artistic. There are a some cultural aspects attached to it too. For example, the leather puppet shows or Shantiniketan leather goods are a case in point of how diversified and culturally significant is the use and creative prowess of leather. Similarly, different states master different artistry producing beautiful footwear, statues, and many other leather crafts.Regionally too the artistry over leather varies and excels. Where Rajasthan and Maharashtra are famous for leather footwear. West Bengal with its own Santiniketan style creates wonderful bags, wallet bags, pouches.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">The most popular footwear includes the Kolhapuri chappals from Kolhapur in Maharashtra. The chappals are an iconic fashion statement, as well as a symbol of tradition. These chappals have been around since the 13th century. When the then King Bijjala encouraged its production for the upliftment of the cobblers. Also, Kolhapuri chappals are handmade using natural ingredients and hence extremely comfortable.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Similarly, mojris or jootis originated under the Mughals. Decorated with crystals or gems and designed with intricate colors and designs the mojris continue to be eye-catching to date. Rajasthan became the hub of mojris where the chamar community first began to process the rawhide and then dyed them using vegetable dyes. They come in different colors and patterns, some embedded, some embroidered. The craft is evident in the design and perhaps this is one of the reasons that even leading fashion designers to incorporate the mojari on the ramp.</p>

### Handmade Leather Shoe Industry
<p style="text-align: justify">India is the only country in the world where you can get the completely handmade leather footwears where as the other producers use machine to produce the leather footwears. But this Industry is not centralized and organized the reason is the artisans involved in this industry is aggregated to the certain part of India i.e. Rajasthan and Maharashtra are famous for leather footwear especially shoes. The artisans involved in this industry produce the shoes based on the order they received from the local shop owners or from middlemen. The shop owners and middlemen purchase the shoes at dirt cheap cost and sell it to customer at higher price and enjoy 60-70 percent profit margin.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">The art and skills are passed from one generation to other and this became the livelihood of some communities and artisans from some specific demographic areas. Most of them are either uneducated or just completed the primary school and they didn't have enough resources to sell their handmade shoes directly to the customer and enjoy higher margin on the shoes.</p>
####  Why handmade Shoe prefered? 
<p style="text-align: justify">There could be alot of reasons but if we try to understand the consumer mentality then the first reason could be the quality of the product or raw material used to make the product and the other reason could be the trust on the handmade products. There are some Big brands selling their shoes and branding them as leather shoes but if we go throught the product and after using them we can get an idea that they are not completely made of leather and some portion of synthetic materials is used that neither properly mold itself to the shape of your feet nor absorb the moisture of the feet. Whereas hand-made shoes are mostly made of pure leather that easily molds to the shape of your foot and it soaks the moisture of your feet very well. However, handmade shoes are little bit on expensive side.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In traditional functions or wedding people wear traditional clothes and to match the attire people want traditional footwear, handmade products are the first preferences.</p>
####  Why Handmade Leather Shoe Industry is not growing same as Footwear Industry?
<p style="text-align: justify">India is only behind China as the largest producer of footwear globally. The leather and non-leather segments, driven by a robust domestic market, make up the Indian footwear industry. According to Invest India’s report on the ‘Non-leather footwear Industry in India’, the sector in India is projected to increase eight-fold by 2030. India’s non-leather footwear industry will soon cross the $6 billion mark by 2024. But the Handmade Leather Shoe Industry is not growing with the same rate.</p>

The reasons are following.
 - Goverment Policies on animal slaughter it is not the biggest one but still it is affecting the growth.
 - <p style="text-align: justify">The rapid evolution of Non-Leather Shoe Industry in which you can get hundreds of types of shoes with different styles and colours. The big brands which are in this space is spending alot to promote their products and lauching new shoes frequently to attract consumers.</p>
 
## Objective
<p style="text-align: justify">The purpose of this research is to figure out why the artisans or the craftmen involved in the Handmade Leather Shoe Industry is not able to make the casual leather shoes where as The Big Brands which are selling leather shoes already started selling the casual leather shoes and captured majority of market and the demand is keep on rising.</p>

## Hypothesis
The Hypothesis involve multiple points to consider either all of them could be true or some of them could be true.
- <p style="text-align: justify">The artisans got the art and skills from their forefathers and they are making the same kind of formal leather shoes from generations so they have the proper understanding and technical knowledge to make formal shoes. But the making of casual shoes or any stylish shoes require some additional knowledge or extra skill and the artisans are lacking here.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify">The artisans use the tradtional tools and raw material(like glue or thread) to make formal shoes but design of casual shoes is not simple as formal shoes, to make the causual shoes you need some special tools or raw material and the artisans don't have access to these things.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify">It is likely possible that artisans have skills and tools to make casual shoes but they don't have any model or design to replicate.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify">The other simple reason could be there is no demand, basically artisans get their orders from the local shop owners and middlemen and they are not placing any order for casual shoes.</p>
